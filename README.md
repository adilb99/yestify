# YEStify
A messaging app with convenient and customizable notifications to keep you concentrated on work when needed and totally social at all other times.

## overview
The repository source directory contains three main `.html` files.<br/>
`index.html` - main chats screen <br>
`settings.html` - a simple yet powerful notifications settings page <br>
`notifs.html` - a separate page to view the notifications. <br>
The `styles` directory contains the `.css` stylesheets and the `scripts` directory contains vanilla JavaScript scripts. There is one stylesheet and one script file per page, and the names correspond to the related `.html` file. <br>
The `src` directory contains the icons and the other source files for the prototype.

## Note
This is just a prototype, so now account creation is available, many of the features are hard-coded, and the messaging functionality is not implemented. Please forgive us
